BOOKS ABOUT BUTTERFLIES</h2>
</div>


<p>Many ancient and mediaeval writers dealt
with butterflies, but the first descriptions of
American species are found in the works of
Linnaeus, the great Swedish naturalist who
wrote about 1750, and invented the system
upon which all modern classification is based.
Pictures of several American butterflies were
published in 1759 by Charles Clerck, who had
studied with Linnaeus.</p>

<p>Johann Christian Fabricius, a professor at
the University of Kiel, published a few more
descriptions in 1796, and Peter Cramer, at
about the same time, brought out four large
volumes on the butterflies of Asia, Africa, and
the Americas. Most of these early books were
written in Latin, and are now so rare and expensive
that few American students have ever
seen them.</p>

<p>Jacob Hübner published his great volumes on
exotic butterflies in the early part of the nineteenth
century. This work was written in
German, and contained more than six hundred
colored plates, but a good copy now costs about
eight hundred dollars, and is of very little use
anyway.</p>

<p>In 1797 Sir James Edward Smith brought out
his two-volume work on <i>The Natural History of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
the Rarer Lepiodopterous Insects of Georgia</i>,
the first books ever devoted exclusively to
North American species. This work is valuable
chiefly because it contains some drawings
by John Abbot, an Englishman who had actually
lived in Georgia and studied moths and
butterflies at first hand. Some of Abbot’s pictures
were later used in another work on
American lepidoptera by Dr. J. A. Boisduval of
Paris, and Major J. L. LeConte of New York,
who wrote in French about 1833. The books
of both Smith and Boisduval are now practically
unobtainable.</p>

<p>In 1841 the Biological Survey Commission of
Massachusetts published a report on injurious
insects by Dr. Thaddeus William Harris, which
described many New England butterflies. It
is now out of print, the last edition appearing
in 1862.</p>

<p>The Rev. John G. Harris brought together a
deal of information from the works of other
writers, and made a few minor observations of
his own; his compilation was published by the
Smithsonian Institution about 1860.</p>

<p>In 1868 William H. Edwards, an engineer
who lived in Coalburg, West Virginia, brought
out the first volume of his famous work, <i>The
Butterflies of North America</i>&mdash;probably the
best book on the subject ever written. Edwards
laboriously worked out the life-histories of many
species, and illustrated the work by careful
drawings and paintings of his own. Two more
volumes appeared later, the last one published
in 1897. <i>The Butterflies of North America</i> is
a magnificent piece of work, produced under all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
sorts of handicaps, and will always be a classic
to American students of the subject.</p>

<p>In 1886 Dr. Samuel Hubbard Scudder published
his <i>Butterflies of New England</i> in three
volumes; this monograph is superbly illustrated,
and compares very favorably even with
the epoch-making work of Edwards. The works
of Edwards and Scudder are probably the best
books on butterflies ever written in any language,
and must always remain as monuments
of American industry and scholarship. Because
of the excessive cost of reproducing the colored
plates, however, they are both rather expensive;
Scudder’s work retailed at ninety dollars,
while Edward’s three volumes never sold
for less than a hundred and fifty, and even this
price, according to Dr. W. J. Holland, was below
the cost of manufacture.</p>

<p><i>The Butterflies of the Eastern United States</i>,
by G. H. French, appeared about 1886. It is a
good little book, and is still in common use, but
the illustrations are few and unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>In 1891 C. J. Maynard published a <i>Manual of
North American Butterflies</i> with ten colored
plates; the plates are very poor indeed, and the
text not much better.</p>

<p>In 1893 Dr. Samuel Hubbard Scudder, the author
of the three great volumes on the New
England species, brought out a little book called
<i>The Life of a Butterfly</i>. It is a brief and popular
account of the life-history of <i>Anosia plexippus</i>,
the Monarch or Milkweed butterfly,
which is common everywhere. Dr. Scudder’s
<i>Brief Guide to the Commoner Butterflies of the
Northern United States and Canada</i> also appeared
in 1893&mdash;a very useful little book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>In 1898 Dr. W. J. Holland, Director of the
Carnegie Museum at Pittsburgh, published his
famous <i>Butterfly Book</i>, in which he described
more than five hundred species, accompanying
each description with a sketch of the life-history
and habits in all cases where these details
were known. The magnificent colored photograph
plates are quite equal for all practical
purposes to the hand-colored drawings of Edwards
and Scudder, and enable the veriest tyro
to classify any of the commoner butterflies simply
by comparing them with the pictures. Besides
the detailed description of each species
there is a great deal of miscellaneous information
of interest to the general reader. Because
of the new process of reproducing photographs
in colors the book sold very cheaply&mdash;never
more than four or five dollars&mdash;and has
done more to arouse a popular interest in butterflies
than all other works together. Many of
the elementary books since 1898 are indebted
to Holland’s book, and the present booklet is no
exception.</p>

<p>In 1905 William Greenwood Wright of San
Francisco, published a book called <i>West Coast
Butterflies</i>. This work is illustrated with colored
plates nearly as good as Holland’s, and is
indispensable to those interested in California
species.</p>

<p>George B. Longstaff’s <i>Butterfly-Hunting in
Many Lands</i> appeared in 1912. The book itself
is of no great interest to North Americans, as
Longstaff spent only two weeks here, and came
no farther south than Montreal. Still, his
chapter of <i>Bionomic Notes</i> deals with butterflies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
in general and is well worth reading. The
best part of the book, however, is the appendix,
which contains E. A. Elliott’s translations of
Fritz Müller’s famous papers on scent-producing
organs in butterflies. The most important
of these had never been published except
in some obscure Portuguese journals,
practically inaccessible to the American student.</p>

<p>In 1916, encouraged by the success of his
<i>Butterfly Book</i>, Dr. Holland prepared a pocket
manual called the <i>Butterfly Guide</i>, with colored
figures representing some two hundred and
fifty species.</p>

<p>In 1917 there appeared Clarence M. Weed’s
<i>Butterflies Worth Knowing</i>, with thirty-two
plates in color. This is one of the best of the
smaller popular books, and contains a great
deal of valuable modern material, but is not to
be compared with Holland’s work.</p>

<p>No important popular books on butterflies
have appeared in recent years. The best single
work for the general reader is still Holland’s
<i>Butterfly Book</i>; those living west of the
Rockies should have Wright’s <i>West Coast Butterflies</i>
also.</p>

THE BUTTERFLY’S BODY
</h2>
</div>

<p>The body of a butterfly, like that of any
other insect, is divided by constrictions into
three parts: the head, the thorax, and the
abdomen. The head carries the eyes, antennae,
and mouth parts; the thorax bears the legs and
wings; and the abdomen the sexual appendages.</p>


<h3 class="center">THE HEAD, EYES, AND MOUTH PARTS</h3>

<p>The <i>head</i> is globular, usually a little flattened
from front to rear. Two large <i>compound
eyes</i> are located at the sides of the head, and
the face or front consists largely of a plate
called the <i>clypeus</i>. Above the clypeus and between
the eyes are the <i>antennae</i> or feelers,
which are believed to be the organs of hearing,
smell, and touch. Below the clypeus is the
<i>labrum</i> or upper lip, and the rudimentary
<i>mandibles</i>; just below these are the two <i>maxillae</i>,
which unite to form a tube called the
<i>proboscis</i>, used in sucking nectar out of flowers.
When not in use the proboscis is coiled
up like a watch-spring between the two three-jointed
<i>labial palpi</i>. The <i>labium</i> or lower lip
is very small in butterflies.</p>


<h3 class="center">THE THORAX, WINGS AND LEGS</h3>

<p>The <i>thorax</i> is composed of three segments,
the front part or prothorax, the middle part
or mesothorax, and the hind part or metathorax.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
The <i>prothorax</i> bears the front legs;
the <i>mesothorax</i> the second pair of legs and the
fore wings; the <i>metathorax</i> carries the third
pair of legs and the hind wings. The under
side of the thorax is called the <i>pectus</i> or breast.
The large muscles which operate the legs and
wings are contained in the thorax. One pair of
<i>spiracles</i> or breathing-holes is found in the
prothorax; the other seven pairs are located
in the abdominal segments.</p>

<p>The butterfly has four <i>wings</i>, which are the
largest and most conspicuous part of the insect.
The wings consist of membranes stretched over
horny tubes called veins; in the newly emerged
insect the veins contain both blood and air,
but the veins of the adult contain air only. The
colors of the wing are due to minute <i>scales</i>
which cover the membranes in an overlapping
fashion like shingles on a roof. The scales vary
considerably in size and form as well as in
color, and the males of some species bear specialized
scales known as <i>androconia</i>, which produce
odors attractive to the females. The third
of the wing nearest the body is the <i>base</i>; the
middle part of the wing is the <i>median</i> or <i>discal</i>
area; the outer portion is called the <i>limbal</i> area.
The front edge is the <i>costal margin</i>; the outer
edge is the <i>external margin</i>; the posterior edge
is known as the <i>inner margin</i>. The angle of
the outer and inner margins of the front wings
is called the outer angle, and the corresponding
angle of the hind wings is the inner or anal
angle. The outmost tip of the front wing is
called the <i>apex</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>The fore wing has three simple veins: the
<i>costal</i>, the <i>radial</i>, and the <i>submedian</i>. There
are also two branching veins, the <i>median</i> and
the <i>subcostal</i>. The median vein has three
branches or nervules, while the subcostal usually
has four or five. The hind wing has five
simple veins: the <i>costal</i>, <i>subcostal</i>, <i>upper radial</i>,
<i>lower radial</i>, <i>submedian</i>, and <i>internal</i>. The
costal vein in the hind wing usually has a short
ascending spur called the <i>precostal</i> vein but it
is classed as a simple vein none the less. The
median vein has three nervules, as in the fore
wing. In both fore and hind wings, between
the subcostal and median veins, there is an area
called the <i>cell</i>, which is often closed or partially
closed on the outer side by three <i>discocellular
veins</i>, designated as upper, middle, and lower.</p>

<p>Each of the six <i>legs</i> is divided into five parts.
The section nearest the body is the <i>coxa</i>, which
is attached to the ring-like <i>trachanter</i>. Next
beyond the trachanter is the <i>femur</i>, then the
<i>tibia</i>, and finally the <i>tarsus</i> or foot bearing the
tarsal claws, which are used in clinging to
various objects when the butterfly is at rest.
In some species the fore legs are small and
quite useless, a fact which is used in classification.</p>


<h3 class="center">THE ABDOMEN</h3>

<p>The <i>abdomen</i> is composed of ten segments;
the first seven bear <i>spiracles</i> or breathing-holes
(completely hidden by scales, however) and the
last two segments are modified to form external
sexual appendages. In the male there is a pair
of <i>claspers</i> for holding the female during copulation;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
in the female there is only a short and
simple <i>ovipositor</i>.</p>


<h3 class="center">THE DIGESTIVE APPARATUS</h3>

<p>The <i>alimentary canal</i>, the principal part of
the digestive apparatus, is a tube extending
through the entire body from the end of the
proboscis to the anal opening. Just above the
proboscis is a <i>bulb</i>, which is enlarged by the
contraction of muscles attached to the hard
parts of the head. When the bulb is expanded
nectar may be sucked up through the proboscis;
then the valve at the end of the proboscis
is closed, and the bulb contracted again. By
this means the liquid is forced back into the
<i>esophagus</i> or gullet, and hence into the <i>crop</i>.
Just behind the crop is the <i>stomach</i>, and just
behind the stomach is the <i>small intestine</i>. From
the small intestine the part of the liquid not
absorbed flows into the <i>large intestine</i>, which
is divided into a front part or <i>colon</i>, and a rear
and lower part called the <i>rectum</i>. From the
rectum the fecal matter passes out of the
body through the <i>anal opening</i>.</p>


<h3 class="center">THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM</h3>

<p>The <i>circulatory system</i> consists essentially of
a single blood vessel, running the entire length
of the body in about the position occupied by
the spinal column in the higher animals. This
tube is open at the rear, and has valves opening
inward all along its sides. In the thorax
there is a pulsating enlargement which serves
as a simple <i>heart</i>. The <i>blood</i> is a colorless
liquid which percolates about through the entire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
body cavity, not being confined to any
particular arteries or veins. It is ultimately
collected into the dorsal blood vessel, and the
pulsating heart keeps it moving, so that it absorbs
food from the stomach and intestines, and
distributes it to the various parts of the body.</p>

<h3 class="center">THE RESPIRATORY TRACT</h3>

<p>Insects have no lungs, and the blood does not
carry oxygen about as in the higher animals;
air is drawn into the body and brought into
direct and immediate contact with the tissues.
In the butterfly there are eight pairs of <i>spiracles</i>
or breathing-holes&mdash;seven pairs in the abdomen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
and one in the prothorax. These spiracles
are connected with large <i>air-sacs</i> reaching
from one end of the body to the other, each
air-sac being provided with minute branching
tubes called <i>tracheae</i>, which carry air directly
to the various tissues of the body. The carbon
dioxide produced in the respiratory changes
passes out through the spiracles, the transfer of
gases being produced largely by movements of
the abdominal muscles.</p>


<h3 class="center">THE EXCRETORY ORGANS</h3>

<p>The abdomen of the butterfly contains a number
of slender <i>Malpighian tubules</i>, in contact
with the blood contained in the various cavities.
These tubules extract waste matter from the
blood, functioning just as kidneys do in the
higher animals. The butterfly has no bladder
or urethra, however; the Malpighian tubules
empty into the small intestine, and the urine
passes out of the body with the fecal matter.</p>


<h3 class="center">THE NERVOUS SYSTEM</h3>

<p>The nervous system consists of the brain,
the subesophageal ganglion, and the ventral
nerve cord, together with branches of these
structures. The <i>brain</i> is a large mass of nerve
tissue in the head just above the esophagus.
The two <i>optic nerves</i> which supply the large
compound eyes make up the principal part of
the brain, being much larger and more complicated
than the <i>cerebrum</i>, which is supposed
to be the organ of sensation.</p>

<p>The <i>subesophageal</i> ganglion is a sort of second
brain lying just below the esophagus; it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
gives off nerves which supply the mouth parts
and control the mechanism of feeding. The
<i>ventral nerve cord</i> runs back from the subesophageal
ganglion and traverses almost the
entire length of the body, being analogous to
the spinal cord of the vertebrates. It bears
three <i>ganglia</i> in the thoracic region which give
off nerves to the legs, wings, and thoracic
muscles. Other ganglia, located in the abdomen,
have many branching nerves which are
distributed to the abdominal muscles and the
viscera.</p>


<h3 class="center">THE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS</h3>

<p>The <i>ovaries</i> in the female butterfly are sometimes
so large as to crowd the other organs in
the abdominal cavity. They communicate by
means of tubes called <i>oviducts</i> with the <i>copulatory</i>
apparatus at the end of the abdomen. The
<i>testes</i> of the male butterfly are usually combined
into a single organ; they discharge the
<i>seminal fluid</i> into the <i>vas deferens</i>, whence it
is conducted to a sort of pouch near the penultimate
segment of the abdomen. In copulation
the ends of the male and female abdomens are
locked together by certain clasping appendages,
and the seminal fluid of the male is forced into
the body of the female, where it meets and fertilizes
the eggs as they descend from the
ovaries.</p>

BUTTERFLY METAMORPHOSIS</h2>
</div>


<p>Some insects, grasshoppers for example, pass
through an <i>incomplete metamorphosis</i>; that is,
the young grasshopper is very much like its
parents except as regards size. This is the
same sort of development found among birds,
reptiles, and other vertebrates. The egg of a
butterfly, however, does not hatch into a miniature
replica of its parents, but into an altogether
different sort of creature, which must
pass through a <i>complete metamorphosis</i> before
it becomes a butterfly. To put the matter briefly,
there are four distinct stages in the life of
a butterfly: the egg, the caterpillar, the chrysalis,
and the imago, or butterfly proper.</p>


<h3 class="center">THE FIRST STAGE OR EGG</h3>

<p>Female butterflies are equipped with organs
called ovaries which produce ova, and male
butterflies have testes which produce sperm.
By an act called copulation (in which the male
and female abdomens are locked together by
appropriate appendages) the sperm of the male
is introduced into the body of the female. A
single spermatozoon fuses with each ovum, and
the result is a fertilized egg. The female deposits
the egg upon a green leaf, and as a rule
each species is limited to one or two particular
kinds of plants. Butterfly eggs are small, but
always large enough to be seen with the naked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
eye, and they vary widely in shape and color
as well as in size.</p>


<h3 class="center">THE SECOND OR LARVAL STAGE</h3>

<p>Most butterfly eggs hatch within a week or
two, producing worm-like larvae called <i>caterpillars</i>,
which differ in appearance according to
the species, but whose general characteristics
are well known. The principal business of a
caterpillar is to eat; no sooner has it emerged
from the egg than it devours the egg-shell, and
then sets to work on the leaves of the food
plant. Its growth is so rapid that the outer
skin must soon be shed, and this shedding process
is known as moulting. Most caterpillars
moult about four times. The caterpillar stage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
usually lasts only a month or so, but there are
a few species which hibernate and spend the
winter as caterpillars.</p>

butterflies. This is the butterfly that mimics
the Monarch; see section on Protective Mimicry.
A, egg; B, caterpillar; C, chrysalis; D, imago.</p>

<h3 class="center">THE THIRD OR PUPAL STAGE</h3>

<p>When the caterpillar is fully grown it spins
a little silken button on some solid object,
hangs itself up by the tail, and undergoes a
final moult. When the old skin peels off this
time it reveals, not a caterpillar with a bright
new skin, but a different sort of creature altogether.
The apparently lifeless pupa or <i>chrysalis</i>
shows some of the characteristics of a
butterfly, but the wings and legs are folded up,
the antennae are cemented fast against the
body, and the whole structure covered by a
horny, tight-fitting sheath. This state of affairs
usually lasts only three or four weeks, but
some butterflies, particularly in temperate climates,
pass the winter in the pupal state.</p>


<h3 class="center">THE FOURTH STAGE OR IMAGO</h3>

<p>When the chrysalis stage is over the outer
skin bursts open about the head, and the <i>imago</i>&mdash;the
butterfly proper&mdash;crawls out. The newly
emerged butterfly is a sorry-looking specimen;
the wings are very small and flaccid, and it can
do no more than cling to some convenient support,
usually the empty skin of the chrysalis.
After a while, however, the body juices flow
out into the wings, which expand and harden,
and in a few hours the young butterfly is flitting
from flower to flower with its fellows.</p>

<p>Ordinarily the imago does not live long&mdash;often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
only a few days. Just as the caterpillar’s
sole business is to eat, the mature butterfly
has only one important function, and that is
reproduction. It speedily finds a mate (that’s
what its wings are for), contributes its quota
of ova or sperm to produce another generation
of caterpillars, and its ephemeral existence as
a butterfly is over.</p>

THE CASE OF THE RED SILVERWING</h2>
</div>


<p>Having dealt briefly with the transformations
of butterflies in general, it may be well
to examine more closely into those of a single
representative species. For this purpose I have
chosen <i>Dione vanillae</i>, known as the Red Silverwing,
and have described each stage and transition
in considerable detail. The following paragraphs
are extracts from the daily records
of a study I made in southern Kansas, the
northern limit of <i>vanillae’s</i> usual range.</p>


<h3 class="center">OVIPOSITION</h3>

<p>“One of the females, alighting upon the upper
side of a leaf within ten inches of my face,
suddenly elevated the forward part of the body,
brought the wings together vertically, curved
the abdomen slightly forward, and drew its tip
slowly across the surface of the leaf for a
distance of approximately 12 mm. Remaining
quiet for an instant, it lifted the abdomen,
showing an egg firmly attached to the leaf.
The eggs are laid singly, usually in the upper
middle of the leaf. I have never seen more
than one upon the same leaf.”</p>


<h3 class="center">THE EGG</h3>

<p>“The egg measures about 1.12 mm. in height
and .7 mm. in diameter at the widest part,
barrel-shaped, with fourteen vertical ribs. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
brilliant yellow at first, it assumes after about
thirty-six hours a reddish brown color. A few
hours later an irregular, whitish broken ring,
not quite circling the egg, appears about one-third
of the distance from the top. When
within an hour or so of hatching the shell
becomes very thin and transparent and reflects
the light with a sort of frosted-glass
effect. The large black head of the larva
inside gives the upper one-third of the egg a
black, metallic appearance, while the yellowish
body may be seen curled up in the lower part.
The incubation period seems to vary greatly
with the temperature, from forty-seven hours
to seven days.”</p>


<h3 class="center">THE EMERGENCE OF THE CATERPILLAR</h3>

<p>“At 2:15 p. m. the larva was clearly visible
through the shell. Slight bodily movements
were noted, then the very large, shining black
head was thrust out at a point on one side of
the egg, just below the top. The entire structure
rocked and swayed slowly back and forth,
inclining toward the side from which the head
projected.</p>

<p>“At 2:19 the larva emerged very slowly, head
first. The head and the final segment appeared
very large. The entire length was
about 1.5 mm. The body yellowish red; prolegs
and caudal segment lemon yellow; the head,
legs and spines black. The latter bear no visible
branches, and appear as stiff, black hairs,
each growing out of a slight black protuberance.</p>

<p>“The beautiful egg-shell remains erect, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
form being unchanged. There is a ragged hole
in it, but it is scarcely noticeable, and appears
hardly large enough for the egress of the
caterpillar.”</p>


<h3 class="center">THE CATERPILLAR</h3>

<p>“The newly emerged larva does not venture
far from the egg-shell and does not move about
much for the first five or six hours. It sometimes
devours the shell, but this is not usually
the case. At the age of six hours it appears
darker, and the black spots from which the
hairlike spines protrude have become more conspicuous.
Has not eaten any of the leaf, and
has increased in size very little if at all.”</p>

<p>“At the age of twenty-seven hours the larva
attains a length of 2.3 mm. and has eaten several
small holes in the center of a large leaf,
gnawing through the leaf to the transparent
epidermis on the opposite side, which is left
intact. Usually works from the upper side, but
by no means invariably.”</p>

<p>“These smaller larvae seem to be always attached
to the leaf with silk, although the
threads are very few and fine. More mature
larvae feed differently; they grip the petiole
with the prolegs, and eat from the edge inward
and forward, swinging the head toward the midrib,
with practically no lateral motion.”</p>

<p>“The caterpillar is cylindrical and bears six
rows of black, branching spines, twelve in each
row. As regards color, there are besides the reddish,
newly hatched creature described above,
two well-defined types: the orange-drab and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
drab-orange. In the first the body appears
orange with three narrow drab stripes, and a
very narrow lateral line just above the prolegs.
In the second the drab markings become very
much more prominent, so that the body now
appears drab with four narrow orange stripes.
The narrow drab dorsal line of the younger
caterpillar becomes very conspicuous in the
mature larva, separating the dorsal surface into
two distinct orange areas. As the orange-drab
type seems to embrace all of the smaller larvae,
and as all those about to pupate belong to
the drab-orange type, I have assumed that the
color change is a matter of maturity.”</p>


<h3 class="center">MOULTING</h3>

<p>“1:30 a. m.&mdash;Larva about 21 mm., inactive and
very dark, extended on lower side of leaf, front
of body high, head bent, holding with third,
fourth and anal prolegs. A few silk threads
lie flat on leaf near caudal end of body. After
some little rippling of muscle (no violent motion)
the skin of the body separates from that
of the head. The former is very tight; slowly,
segment by segment, it is skinned backward
until finally it is left, a crumpled, prickly black
ball about 4 mm. in diameter, fastened to the
leaf by the aforementioned silk. Meanwhile the
head covering, which is all of a piece and bears
two large spines, slips forward until it appears
to be held in the mandibles as a hat might be
held between the teeth. After a moment it falls
to the ground. The caterpillar now appears
somewhat short and a trifle thickened. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
head, legs and prolegs are yellow, the body
orange. The spines are only half size, blunt,
yellow and semi-transparent. The branches appear
as black hairs lying flat along the sides
of the spines.”</p>

<p>“11:33 a. m.&mdash;The spines have now attained
practically their normal size, springing out
with astonishing rapidity. They are still blunt,
yellow and semi-transparent, but the black
branches have reached normal size and assumed
their proper position. The two head spines,
which were curled backward, have taken on
the usual angle. The head, body and prolegs
now appear orange rather than yellow, the
head being lightest. The drab dorsal stripe
has appeared, but is very narrow. The row of
depressions, one in the dorsal center of each
segment, is much more conspicuous than usual.”</p>

<p>“11:50 a. m.&mdash;Appears quite normal again,
except that the spines are not quite as black,
showing grayish toward the tips. The black
frontal markings appear. Caterpillar rests motionless.”</p>

<p>“12:10 p. m.&mdash;Turns about and begins to devour
the cast-off skin. With the lens I watched
it begin at the tip of one of the big spines and
consume it clear to the root, apparently in
about three mouthfuls. The head covering is
never eaten.”</p>

<p>“12:30 p. m.&mdash;Skin practically consumed.
Larva rests motionless, a few of the surplus
spines resting beneath the head and thorax.”</p>


<h3 class="center">PUPATION</h3>

<p>“10:00 a. m.&mdash;Caterpillar, 37 mm. long, leaves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
food plant and begins to wander restlessly
about.</p>

<p>“1:00 p. m.&mdash;Extended motionless, clinging to
under side of window frame.</p>

<p>“2:30 p. m.&mdash;Same position.</p>

<p>“3:30 p. m.&mdash;Begins to lay a sparse, ragged
network of very fine threads flat to the surface,
covering a space of perhaps an inch
square. These threads become thinner toward
the periphery of the net, where they are hardly
visible without a lens.</p>

<p>“4:00 p. m.&mdash;Spins a little white silk button
in the center of the network. The head moves
slowly out horizontally in all directions from
the button about one-half inch, swinging always
back to the center. The body is fully extended,
the abdomen being away from the button.</p>

<p>“4:30 p. m.&mdash;Interrupted the button-making
to raise high the caudal third of the body,
spreading the anal appendages apart several
times. When a pellet of excrement appeared,
the caterpillar turned about and pulled it out
of the anal opening with the mandibles, holding
it thus a moment before allowing it to fall
to the floor.</p>

<p>“4:45 p. m.&mdash;Resting, body extended, clasping
the button with the third prolegs.</p>

<p>“6:00 p. m.&mdash;Fastened to the button. The
body is extended horizontally, clinging to the
under surface of the window frame with the
prolegs; head drawn back, legs not touching
the surface.</p>

<p>“8:00 p. m.&mdash;Hanging from the button. The
body is thickened a trifle and shortened to 31<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
mm. Color much lighter; hangs motionless except
for very slight movements of the legs and
prolegs.”</p>

<p>“9:00 a. m.&mdash;No change.</p>

<p>“10:00 a. m.&mdash;The brilliant colors have practically
disappeared, leaving the body a pearl-gray
color, against which the black spines show
up with startling distinctness. Movements
slight and infrequent. The dorsal thorax is now
the lightest part of the body.</p>

<p>“11:00 a. m.&mdash;Begins to wriggle a little.</p>

<p>“11:10 a. m.&mdash;I note that the spines appear
closer together at the caudal end of the body;
then see that the skin has split down the back
and that the light-colored head of the chrysalis
is protruding. By a series of vigorous wrigglings
the skin is slowly forced up to where
the tip of the abdomen is attached to the button.
Then comes the violent struggle which
finally loosens the skin, which hangs for a
moment against the ventral abdomen, then
falls to the floor. The entire moult is complete
in less than five minutes.”</p>


<h3 class="center">THE CHRYSALIS</h3>

<p>“When the chrysalis first appears it is nearly
cylindrical; no dorsal depression, no ventral
bulge. The head is bent forward, and the
whole thing has a compact, slug-like appearance.
An hour or so later the head is no longer
bent, and bears two double projections, set
wide apart; the wing cases are bulging and
prominent; on the dorsal side, opposite the
middle of the wing covers, is a U-shaped depression;
there are projections on the third,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
fifth, sixth, and seventh abdominal segments,
those on the third being the largest. At first
the head, thorax and wing covers are translucent
and nearly white; the abdomen is a little
darker and bears a ventral bluish stripe
on the fourth, fifth and sixth segments. The
four pairs of dorsal protuberances are amber-colored.</p>

<p>“An hour later the head and thorax darken
somewhat, and opaque whitish veins appear
in the wing covers. Distinct black lines mark
the outer borders of the fore wings, and a black
V-shaped mark shows the position of the larger
of the three discal spots.</p>

<p>“Another hour and the translucent appearance
is gone, the abdomen and the dorsal thorax
become much darker, the wing covers grayish
tan, while the bluish ventral stripe turns
gray or white.</p>

<p>“From this time forward the chrysalis does
not change appreciably in form or color (although
the latter varies greatly) until about
twenty-four hours before the emergence of the
butterfly, when the entire body becomes very
dark.</p>

<p>“The average length of the chrysalis is 28
mm., and the white ventral stripe is usually
the most conspicuous marking. After the butterfly
has emerged the color variations of the
chrysalis still persist in the empty shells, some
being much darker than others.</p>

<p>“Not infrequently the cast skin of the larva
is found attached to the anal portion of the
chrysalis. This skin is black excepting the
head, which is gray, and the black branching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
spines loom large because of the contraction
of the empty skin.</p>

<p>“Sometimes the chrysalids turn bright yellow;
these are usually infested by parasites. I
have opened many of these pupae, but have
never found the parasitic larva itself; the
pupae and adults I have often taken, the latter
being a small (2.3 mm.), green hymenopterous
insect which I have not as yet had the opportunity
to classify. Some ten or a dozen of these
insects emerge from a small round hole, usually
in the wing cover, in early August.”</p>


<h3 class="center">PUPAL MOVEMENTS</h3>

<p>“The chrysalis seems unable to bend the body
toward the back or toward the wing covers;
sidewise, however, it can turn until the body
is extended nearly parallel to the horizontal
surface from which it is suspended. Six chrysalids
which hung in a north window in September,
1919, and which I observed for fourteen
days, were noted to be invariably and unanimously
pointed inward (toward the warm room,
that is) every morning. During the warmer
part of the day there was no uniformity in
position. Six specimens&mdash;fourteen days; it appears
to be more, perhaps, than mere coincidence.
The pupal sensibility to light and
temperature stimulii should be worth investigation.”</p>


<h3 class="center">THE APPEARANCE OF THE BUTTERFLY</h3>

<p>“Two or three weeks after pupation (the
period varies with the temperature, from eight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
days in August to twenty-seven in November)
the chrysalis turns nearly black, and a diagonal
fissure appears on either side, extending
from the back of the head down along the
antenna cases, nearly to the middle ventrum.</p>

<p>“About twelve hours later, after some little
wriggling, the ventral triangle formed by the
covering of the head, antennae and mouth parts
falls open trap-door fashion, the antennae covers
serving as hinges and the flexing point being
about one-third of the distance up the wing
covers from the abdomen. There is also a dorsal
cleavage following the medial dorsum to
the first abdominal segment, then the outline
of the wing covers to a point half way to the
end of the antenna covers. The crumpled-winged
imago wriggles out and mounts the
empty shell, to which it clings by the four
hinder limbs, turning the entire body back
and forth as if mounted on a pivot. In each
of these turns the body describes an arc of
nearly 90 degrees, the body being held stiff.
The angle of the body is about 45 degrees from
the vertical, the head being uppermost. The
proboscis is usually partially unrolled. In five
or six hours the soft, wrinkled wings spread
and harden, and the insect is able to fly. A
thin, transparent liquid, and sometimes a thick,
reddish substance, are voided by the newly
emerged butterfly.”</p>

THE CLASSIFICATION OF BUTTERFLIES</h2>
</div>


<p>In every science it is necessary to manipulate
a large number of related facts, and this
cannot be done unless the data are arranged in
some systematic and orderly fashion. In order
to make use of the facts about butterflies, one
must know something of the relation of one
butterfly to another, and the relation of butterflies
in general to the rest of the animal kingdom.</p>


<h3 class="center">SUBKINGDOMS, CLASSES, ORDERS, AND
SUBORDERS</h3>

<p>Members of the animal kingdom which have
no spinal column, but only an external skeleton
composed of horny rings, are assigned to
the subkingdom <i>Arthropoda</i>. Arthropods which
have six legs are grouped together in the class
<i>Insecta</i>. Insects with scales on their wings
are assigned to the order called <i>Lepidoptera</i>.
This order is divided into two suborders, the
<i>Rhopalocera</i> or butterflies and the <i>Heterocera</i>
or moths. Butterflies fly in the daytime, and
have slender antennae with club-like knobs at
the ends; moths are usually nocturnal or
crepuscular, and their antennae are not
knobbed, but are thread-like, feather-like, or
hooked at the extremity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>


<h3 class="center">THE FOUR FAMILIES</h3>

<p>The suborder Rhopalocera is divided into
four families: the <i>Nymphalidae</i>, the <i>Lycaenidae</i>,
the <i>Papilionidae</i>, and the <i>Hesperiidae</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Nymphalidae</i> or four-footed butterflies
make up the largest family; the first pair
of legs are much smaller than the others, and
are quite useless for walking. Most of the
Nymphalidae are large or medium-sized butterflies.
The caterpillars are usually provided with
spines or fleshy protuberances, and the chrysalids
are always suspended by the tail.</p>

<p>The <i>Lycaenidae</i> or gossamer-wings are the
bright little butterflies known as “blues,” “hair-streaks,”
and “coppers.” The males do not use
the first pair of legs in walking, but the females
do. The caterpillars are small and usually
slug-shaped, and the chrysalids are held
closely attached to some object by a girdle of
silk.</p>

<p>The <i>Papilionidae</i> is the family of the swallowtails
and allied forms. Both sexes use all
six feet in walking. The butterflies are usually
large or medium-sized; many of the caterpillars
produce disagreeable odors; the chrysalids are
suspended by the tail and provided with a
girdle of silk, but not drawn up to the surface
to which they are attached, as in the case of
the <i>Lycaenidae</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Hesperids</i> or skippers are small butterflies
with thick, moth-like bodies and a peculiar
manner of flight. Both sexes have six
walking feet. The caterpillars are smooth and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
thin-necked, with large globular heads. The
chrysalids are usually enclosed in a flimsy cocoon
of leaves fastened together with a few
silk threads.</p>


<h3 class="center">SUBFAMILIES, GENERA, AND SPECIES</h3>

<p>Each one of these four families is divided
into several subfamilies; each subfamily is divided
into several genera, and each genus is
divided into several species, all of these divisions
being based on an increasing anatomical
similarity. Thus the common Milkweed Butterfly
belongs to the class <i>Insecta</i>, the order <i>Lepidoptera</i>,
the suborder <i>Rhopalocera</i>, the family
<i>Nymphalidae</i>, the subfamily <i>Euploeinae</i>, the
genus <i>Anosia</i>, and the species <i>Plexippus</i>.</p>


<h3 class="center">THE VALUE OF SCIENTIFIC NOMENCLATURE</h3>

<p>One may well ask why we do not simply say
“milkweed butterfly” and have done with it,
but this term refers merely to the fact that
the caterpillar feeds upon a certain plant, while
<i>Anosia plexippus</i> places the specimen definitely
in the scientific scheme of things, and designates
important structural distinctions which
have nothing to do with milkweeds. The average
American is prone to call any insect a
“bug” or “moth-miller” or some such unenlightening
name, so that many butterflies have no
common English name at all, while others have
many different names which vary widely
in different parts of the country. Besides, the
Greek and Latin names are understood by scientists
in all countries, and are less liable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
corruption than terms taken from the modern
languages.</p>

<p>There are difficulties enough in the scientific
nomenclature, without complicating matters
by the introduction of popular names. It
is a fixed rule in science that the first man to
discover and describe a species has the right
to name it, and that whatever name he chooses
shall be used by everybody forever, but scientists
are only human after all, and are always
anxious to discover new species and name them
after their friends or sweethearts. It often
happens that a single species is described independently
by several authors, each of which
applies a name of his own devising; in this
case the first is the real name, and the others
are called synonyms.</p>

<p>In writing about butterflies it is not customary
to spell out the generic name; one does
not write <i>Dione vanillae</i>, but merely <i>D. vanillae</i>.
It is usual also to add the name of the man
who first named the species, so that the name
becomes <i>D. vanillae</i>, Linnaeus, or <i>D. vanillae</i>,
Linn. In conversation one may omit the name
of the genus altogether, and refer to the butterfly
simply as <i>Vanillae</i>. It is well to remember
that scientific Latin in this country is pronounced
in the insular fashion&mdash;that is, the
words are pronounced as if they were English.</p>


<h3 class="center">VARIETIES</h3>

<p>Sometimes the individuals of a species differ
in different parts of the country; these
different forms are called <i>varieties</i>, and are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
designated by a varietal name added to the
generic and specific names. <i>Papilio turnus</i>,
Linn. is a large yellow swallowtail, but in the
southern part of its range some of the females
are black. The black female was formerly
regarded as a distinct species, and Linnaeus
named it <i>Papilio glaucus</i>, but when it was
reared from eggs laid by a yellow female it
was recognized as a variety, and is now known
as <i>Papilio turnus</i>, Linn., var. <i>glaucus</i>.</p>

THE FOUR FAMILIES</h2>
</div>


<p>As we said in the chapter on Classification,
American butterflies fall naturally into four
great groups called families: the <i>Nymphalidae</i>
or Four-footed family, the <i>Lycaenidae</i> or Gossamer-winged
family, the <i>Papilionidae</i> or Swallowtail
family, and the <i>Hesperiidae</i> or Skipper
family.</p>


<h3 class="center">THE FOUR-FOOTED BUTTERFLIES</h3>

<p>The largest family of butterflies in America
is the <i>Nymphalidae</i>, and its members are called
four-footed butterflies because the front legs
are so small as to be useless, leaving only four
walking feet. Most of the butterflies are large
or medium-sized, the caterpillars are usually
provided with spines or fleshy protuberances,
and the chrysalids are always suspended by the
tail. The family is divided into five subfamilies;
the <i>Euploeinae</i>, the <i>Heliconiinae</i>, the
<i>Nymphalinae</i>, the <i>Satyrinae</i>, and the <i>Libytheinae</i>.</p>


<h3 class="center">THE EUPLOEINAE</h3>

<p>So far as the great majority of readers are
concerned, this subfamily includes but one species&mdash;<i>Anosia
plexippus</i>, the familiar Monarch
or Milkweed butterfly, which is common every
summer in every state in the Union. The main<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
color of the wings is bright reddish brown,
but the edges are black, and there are some
white spots in the black area, particularly in
the fore wings. The pale green eggs are laid
upon the milkweed, and soon hatch into little
black and white caterpillars. The mature
caterpillar is greenish yellow with black bands,
and each end of the body bears a pair of slender
black “horns” or <i>filaments</i>. The stout chrysalis
is green with golden markings. This butterfly
has a bitter taste, and so is not molested
by birds or insectivorous mammals. For this
reason <i>Anosia plexippus</i> has become very abundant
and spread over a vast territory. Other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
butterflies which happen to resemble it share
in this protection even though they have no
disagreeable flavor, and this has given rise
to the phenomena of <i>mimicry</i>, which is discussed
elsewhere in this book. Another interesting
thing about the Monarch is the fact
that it does not hibernate in any stage; the
eggs, caterpillars, and chrysalids die when the
cold weather overtakes them, while the adults
gather in great swarms and migrate southward,
where they breed continuously throughout the
winter. With the advent of warm weather
the young southern Monarchs come north, deposit
their eggs on northern milkweed, and
the cycle begins again.</p>

caterpillar; C, pupa or chrysalis; D, imago.</p>


<h3 class="center">THE HELICONIANS</h3>

<p>This is a tropical subfamily, and has only
one representative within the borders of the
United States. <i>Heliconius charitonius</i>, the
Zebra butterfly, is a slender, long-winged,
black-and-yellow species common along the
roadsides of southern Florida. This butterfly
has such an evil taste and odor that no known
animal will eat it. The eggs are deposited
upon the passion-flower vine; the young larva
is hairy, but the mature caterpillar is provided
with a great number of branching spines. The
chrysalis is dark brown and of an odd shape;
it makes a peculiar creaking sound by moving
its abdomen. Another interesting fact about
this Zebra butterfly is that the males are attracted
to female chrysalids, and may be seen
hovering about waiting for their mates to
emerge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>


<h3 class="center">THE NYMPHALINAE</h3>

<p>This is the largest of all the subfamilies,
numbering more than a hundred and seventy
species in the United States. They are mostly
large or of medium size, and include many of
the commonest and most conspicuous butterflies
we have. One of the most interesting
members of this group is <i>Dione vanillae</i>, the
Red Silverspot. The wings are bright red on
the upper surface, with black veins and markings;
the under side shows a spangled effect
of brown and silver. The wings are unusually
long, and the butterfly has a disagreeable odor
which protects it from its enemies; these and
other facts have led some lepidopterists to
class this butterfly with the Heliconians. The
eggs are reddish brown in color, and are found
on the passion-vine; the caterpillar is marked
with orange and drab, and bears six rows of
branching spines. The chrysalis has an unusual
form due to a pronounced dorsal depression;
it is usually a grayish tan in color. <i>Dione
vanillae</i> is found in the whole southern half of
the United States, being especially abundant
about New Orleans, and in southern California.
W. H. Edwards took a specimen at Coalburg,
West Virginia, and it has been reported
from as far north as Worcester, Mass.</p>

<p><i>Grapta interrogationis</i>, the Question Mark
butterfly, is common in all parts of the United
States except the Pacific coast region. The
upper sides of both wings are reddish brown,
spotted with dark brown and edged with a
faint violet color. The peculiar angular shape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
of the fore wings, and the little tails on the
hind wings, are the outstanding characteristics
of the Question Mark and its relatives. The
under side of the wings shows a mottled light
brown, like a dead leaf; on the under side
of the hind wing is found the silver mark resembling
a Greek interrogation point (something
like the English semicolon) which gave
the butterfly its name. The eggs are deposited
on elm trees, hop-vines, and several kinds of
nettles. The caterpillar is reddish in color,
covered with branching spines. The chrysalis
is brown or greenish, with a conspicuous protuberance
in the thoracic region.</p>

<p><i>Vanessa antiopa</i>, the Mourning Cloak butterfly,
may be remembered as the first butterfly
to be seen in the early Spring. The upper
surface of the wings is a rich reddish purple,
with a yellow border and a row of blue spots
just inside it. The under side is gray, and
blends perfectly with the dead twigs upon
which the butterfly is accustomed to perch.
The eggs are laid in clusters on the elm, willow,
and poplar trees; the dark, spiny caterpillars
live in small colonies, and spin a sort
of web among the leaves of the food plant.
The chrysalid is much like that of the Question
Mark butterfly. In the autumn the
Mourning Cloak crawls into a hollow tree or
under a bit of loose bark and sleeps all through
the winter, often flying in the Spring before
the snow has melted, and long before the first
leaves have appeared.</p>

<p><i>Junonia coenia</i>, the Peacock butterfly, is a
medium-sized butterfly with an expanse of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
about two and one-fourth inches. The large
eye-spots on both wings give it a characteristic
appearance, very different from any other butterfly
in this country. It occurs in all parts
of the United States, but is somewhat rare in
the northern part of its range. The dark
green eggs are deposited on various kinds of
plantain; the caterpillar is dark and covered
with spines; the chrysalis generally light
brown, and has a conspicuous depression in
the ventral thorax. This butterfly is conspicuous
for its pugnacity; it will drive away
any other species which chances to approach,
and even dart at stones or other objects thrown
in the air.</p>

<p><i>Basilarchia disippus</i>, the Viceroy butterfly,
looks very much like <i>Anosia plexippus</i> the
Monarch, except for a single transverse black
band on the hind wings. The eggs are laid
upon willow or poplar leaves; the caterpillar
has no spines, but there are two club-shaped
appendages just back of the head; the chrysalis
is light gray with brown spots, and has a
fin-like projection on back of the thorax. The
Viceroy spends the winter in the larval state.
When cold weather sets in the caterpillar anchors
a leaf to the twig by means of silken
threads, then rolls himself up in the leaf and
sleeps until the following Spring.</p>

<p><i>Chlorippe celtis</i>, the Hackberry butterfly, is
smaller than most of the common four-footed
butterflies, its expanse being less than two
inches. The general color of the wings is
gray, but the outer part of the fore wings is
black with broken rows of white spots. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
is a little red tinge about an eye-spot in the
fore wing, and five such spots are located near
the outer edge of the hind wing. The female is
slightly larger than the male, and somewhat
less pronounced in color. The eggs are deposited
in clusters on the hackberry trees; the
caterpillar bears a pair of antler-like appendages
on its head; the chrysalis is stockily
built, with the head deeply notched. The Hackberry
butterfly is found in all the Southern
States east of the Rockies, and has been reported
as far north as southern Pennsylvania.
It is double-brooded in the middle west, the
last caterpillars hibernate and do not reach
maturity until the next year.</p>


<h3 class="center">THE SATYRINAE</h3>

<p>The members of this subfamily are medium-sized,
obscurely colored, forest-loving butterflies,
conspicuous because of their peculiar
manner of flopping about in the grass and
low herbage.</p>

<p><i>Satyrus alope</i>, the Wood-nymph butterfly, is
a medium-sized grayish brown species, with a
broad yellow band across the fore wing. This
yellow area contains two eye-spots, dark with
blue centers, and in the male there is a smaller
eye-spot in the hind wing also. There is a good
deal of regional variation in this species: specimens
from the Northwest are often small and
dark, with a reddish tinge on the lower side
of the wings; while in those from northern
New England and eastern Canada the yellow
band is very dim, and the eye-spots are only
vaguely indicated. The eggs are barrel-shaped,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
and are laid upon various kinds of grasses;
the caterpillar has two slender diverging anal
horns; the chrysalis is green, with a prominent
tubercle on the thorax. The Wood-nymph
is not a strong flyer, but flits about in a furtive,
moth-like fashion; if pursued it will often
close the wings and fall like a leaf into the
grass. These butterflies are usually single
brooded, and pass the winter in the larval
state.</p>


<h3 class="center">THE LIBYTHEINAE</h3>

<p>The butterflies of this subfamily are easily
recognized by the very long projecting palpi,
which have the appearance of a beak or snout.
<i>Libythea bachmanni</i>, the common Snout-butterfly,
is a small, reddish brown species, with
three or four white spots near the tip of the
fore wing. The eggs are found upon Hackberry
leaves; the caterpillar has a small head
and two or three enlarged thoracic segments;
the chrysalis has a sharply pointed head and
a conical abdomen. This species probably
spends the winter in the chrysalis condition.</p>


<h3 class="center">THE GOSSAMER-WINGED BUTTERFLIES</h3>

<p>The Lycaenidae is the family of delicate
little butterflies known as “blues,” “coppers,”
and “hair-streaks.” Metallic blue, red, and
grey are the predominating colors, and the
“hair-streaks” usually have an orange spot on
the hind wings. The males of this family do
not use the first pair of legs in walking, but
the females walk with all six feet. The caterpillars
are small and usually slug-shaped, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
the chrysalids are held closely to some supporting
object by a girdle of silk.</p>


<h3 class="center">THE LYCAENINAE</h3>

<p><i>Lycaena pseudargiolus</i> is the common little
blue butterfly found in every part of the
United States except the far West. It is extremely
subject to seasonal and geographic
variations, seven or eight distinct varieties
having been described. The wings of some
specimens are almost black, others are a very
pale blue, while still others combine the blue
ground-color with a broad black border. The
eggs are laid upon a great variety of plants;
the caterpillars are very small and slug-shaped,
and usually feed upon flowers instead of leaves.
The caterpillar produces a sweet liquid which
attracts ants, and it is said that these ants
protect the caterpillar from minute parasitic
flies which would otherwise destroy it.</p>

<p><i>Feniseca tarquinus</i>, the Wanderer, is perhaps
the most interesting of the so-called copper
butterflies. The Wanderer’s wings are orange
brown, spotted with black on the upper side.
It is found all over the eastern half of the
United States, extending well into the Mississippi
valley. The butterfly is remarkable in
that it does not frequent flowers, but flits
about colonies of plant-lice, and lives upon the
sweet excrement of these insects. The eggs are
laid among the plant-lice also, and the caterpillar
is carnivorous&mdash;the only caterpillar in
North America which feeds upon plant-lice instead
of plants. The chrysalis is small, brown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
in color, and bears a striking resemblance to
the face of a miniature monkey.</p>

<p><i>Thecla melinus</i>, the common Hair-streak, is
a dark bluish gray, with a deep orange spot
just in front of two tiny tails on the hind
wing. It is found all over temperate North
America. The turban-shaped eggs are usually
deposited on the hop-vine; the caterpillar is
a slug-like creature with a small head, which
can be extended to a remarkable extent. The
brown chrysalis lies close to the surface to
which it is attached, being fastened both at
the tail and by a slight silken girdle about
the middle.</p>


<h3 class="center">THE SWALLOWTAILS AND THEIR ALLIES</h3>

<p>The family <i>Papilionidae</i> includes many of the
commonest and showiest of our butterflies. The
adults of both sexes have six ambulatory feet;
the caterpillars are elongate; the chrysalids
are attached at the tail and held in place by
a silken girdle, but never fastened close to
the supporting surface, as the Lycaenids are.
The Papilionidae is divided into two subfamilies:
the <i>Pierinae</i> and the <i>Papilioninae</i>.</p>


<h3 class="center">THE PIERINAE</h3>

<p>This is the subfamily of the small and medium-sized
butterflies, white and yellow in color,
so common about pastures and roadsides.
<i>Pieris rapae</i>, the cabbage butterfly, is one of
the most familiar species. It is a white butterfly,
with one or two black dots and tips on
the fore wings. The pale yellow eggs are deposited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
on cabbage plants; the smooth green
caterpillar eats an enormous amount of sauerkraut
material, and turns into a gray or brownish
chrysalis. This butterfly was originally a
European species; imported through some accident,
it appeared in Quebec about 1860. As
early as 1868 it was common about New York,
and by 1881 had spread to all of the eastern
states. In 1886 it was reported from Denver,
and has since taken possession of cabbage-fields
in every part of the country.</p>

<p><i>Colias philodice</i>, the Common Yellow, is the
butterfly seen swarming about roadside mud-puddles
in August and September. The wings
are lemon color with black borders, and in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
female the borders are usually broken by several
small yellow spots. The yellow or reddish
eggs are laid upon various kinds of clover; the
slender green caterpillar is exactly the color
of the leaves; the chrysalis is usually pale
green also. This butterfly is found from New
England to Florida, and as far west as the
Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p><i>Terias lisa</i> is another yellow butterfly, much
smaller than Colias philodice, rarely expanding
more than an inch and a quarter. The wings
are lemon yellow with black borders, subject
to many minor variations. The caterpillar
feeds on clover, but the early stages of this
species have never been thoroughly studied, despite
the fact that the butterfly is common
from the New England states to the Rockies.</p>

<p><i>Terias mexicana</i>, the Mexican Yellow, is
larger than <i>Terias lisa</i>, and somewhat paler in
color. The black borders or the fore wings
are very wide and indented, and the hind wings
are pointed. Very little is known of its early
stages. It is common in Texas, Arizona, and
Southern California, and often strays much
farther north. I have myself taken a number
of specimens in Kansas.</p>


<h3 class="center">THE PAPILIONINAE</h3>

<p>This is the subfamily of the true swallowtails,
the largest and most distinctive of American
butterflies. The hind wings are prolonged
into two tail-like projections, and are characterized,
by the absence of the internal vein. The
caterpillars are all provided with peculiar V-shaped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
scent-organs called <i>osmateria</i>; these organs
are thrust out just back of the head when
the insect is disturbed, and give off an offensive
odor, supposed to discomfit birds and other
enemies.</p>

<p><i>Papilio troilus</i>, the Green-clouded Swallowtail,
is velvety black with a row of yellow
spots along the margin of the fore wings. The
marginal spots on the hind wing are pale green,
and the whole outer half of the hind wing is
clouded with the same greenish tinge. The
female deposits her eggs on sassafras and spicebush
leaves; the caterpillar is lead-colored or
greenish, with a swollen thorax bearing two
large eye-spots, and lives in a nest made of a
folded leaf. <i>Papilio troilus</i> is common throughout
the Atlantic States and in the Mississippi
Valley.</p>

<p><i>Papilio turnus</i>, the Tiger Swallowtail, is the
magnificent yellow-and-black species found in
practically every part of the United States. In
the northern portion of its range the male and
female appear very much alike, but in the
South there are two distinct types of females.
One female is black-and-yellow like its northern
sisters; the other is black-and-blue, with no
yellow at all except a few small crescents in
the outer border of the hind wing. The black
female, was for a long while considered a distinct
species and called <i>Papilio glaucus</i>. Later,
however, it was discovered that some of the
eggs laid by the yellow <i>turnus</i> produced the
black <i>glaucus</i> females, and that, conversely, the
eggs of <i>glaucus</i> often produced the ordinary
yellow-and-black Tiger Swallowtail. The smooth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
bluish-green eggs are usually found on the
wild cherry leaves; the caterpillar is green,
with enlarged thoracic segments bearing two
large eye-spots like those of Papilio troilus.</p>

<p><i>Papilio ajax</i>, the Zebra Swallowtail, is another
striking member of this magnificent subfamily.
The combination of green and black
stripes, the blue and red crescents and the long
tails on the hind wings, distinguish <i>ajax</i> immediately
from any of its splendid fellows.
There are at least three slightly different seasonal
varieties of this butterfly, due probably
to differences in the temperature to which the
chrysalids are exposed. The butterfly may
often be seen hovering about pawpaw bushes,
upon which the eggs are deposited. The mature
caterpillar is pea-green with bands of yellow
and black; the chrysalis is green or brownish,
and the last crop of chrysalids does not
produce butterflies until the following Spring.
This butterfly ranges from New England south
to the Florida Keys, and west to the foot-hills
of the Rockies.</p>

<p><i>Papilio cresphontes</i>, the Giant Swallowtail,
is the largest butterfly in this country, measuring
nearly six inches from tip to tip. The
color is dark brown with bands and blotches
of bright yellow, and there is a red-and-blue
spot on the inner margin of the hind wings.
The under side of both wings is yellow, with
narrow dark brown bands. This butterfly is
very common in Florida, where the caterpillars&mdash;the
natives call them orange-dogs&mdash;do a
great deal of damage to the orange and lemon
trees. Each female butterfly is known to lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
a great number of eggs, and it has been suggested
that the ravages of the orange-dog may
be checked by shooting the butterflies on the
wing with miniature shotguns. In recent
years the species has extended its range northward,
and has become quite common in the
Middle West; a number of specimens have been
taken in New England, and even in Canada.
In the northern part of its territory there are
no citrus trees, but the caterpillar feeds well
enough upon prickly ash and several kinds of
poplars.</p>


<h3 class="center">THE SKIPPERS</h3>

<p>The <i>Hesperiidae</i> or Skipper family includes
all the large bodied, small-winged, moth-like
butterflies, called Skippers because of their
jerky, erratic manner of flight. They are mostly
small, dull colored butterflies with short,
hooked antennae. The caterpillars are recognized
by their large heads and small necks, and
usually live in nests made of leaves fastened
together with silk. The chrysalids are rounded
and moth-like, and (unlike all the other families)
are usually enclosed in a loose cocoon of
silk. The classification of Skippers is a complicated
business; the Hesperiidae is the only
family in which the beginner will find it difficult
to identify his specimens.</p>

<p><i>Epargyreus tityrus</i>, the Silver-spotted Skipper,
is the largest member of the family, with
an expanse of about one and three-fourths
inches. The general color is dark brown, with
yellowish spots; the common name is derived
from the silver area on the lower surface of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
the hind wing, which shows when the insect
is at rest. The caterpillar is yellowish green,
with a dark brown head; it feeds upon the
leaves of the locust and other leguminous trees.
When the caterpillar is mature it leaves its
hammock in the locust tree and builds a light
silken cocoon upon or near the ground. The
Silver-spotted Skipper is found in nearly every
part of the United States.</p>

<p class="blockquot">

States and Canada. A, egg; B, caterpillar; C
chrysalis; D, imago.</p>

<p><i>Atalopedes huron</i>, the Sachem Skipper, is a
little golden brown species, with an expanse
of a little more than an inch. The male has
a darker area in the center of the front wing,
while in the female the fore wing is marked by
several small white spots. When at rest this
skipper and its near relatives usually elevate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
the fore wings and depress the hind wings, an
attitude characteristic of this group. The dark,
cylindrical caterpillar feeds upon various
grasses: the chrysalis is slender, with a little
swelling upon the thorax, and the tongue
sheath is free as in the pupae of moths. The
Sachem is known from New York to Florida,
and as far west as eastern Colorado.</p>

<p><i>Ancyloxipha numitor</i>, the Least Skipper, is
the smallest butterfly within our borders,
measuring often less than three-fourths of an
inch from tip to tip. The slender body and
hookless antennae distinguish it from all other
skippers. The general color is bright reddish
brown, the hind wings being particularly brilliant,
and surrounded by a darker border. Its
flight is weak and wavering, and it rests often
among grasses at the edges of creeks or
swamps. The yellow eggs are laid on grasses;
the tiny yellow caterpillar has a black head
and a body covered with bristles, and lives in
a rolled-up blade of grass. The chrysalis is
reddish, with small black dots. The Least
Skipper is widely distributed everywhere east
of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
ENEMIES AND PROTECTION</h2>
</div>


<p>Butterflies have many enemies. Even the
eggs of butterflies are often discovered by tiny,
four-winged parasites, which pierce the egg-shell
and deposit their own microscopic eggs inside.
These eggs produce little grubs, which
devour the contents of the butterfly’s egg, so
that the latter develops into a caterpillar.</p>

<p>The chief enemies of the butterfly tribe,
however, are the insectivorous birds, whose
summer food often consists largely of caterpillars.
Caterpillars are also attacked by wasp-like
parasites which deposit their eggs in the
victim’s skin; when the eggs hatch the parasitic
grubs feed upon the flesh of their unwilling
host, who usually dies about the time the guests
are ready to pupate. One often sees dead or dying
caterpillars covered with the white cocoons
of these hymenopterous parasites. Certain
larger wasps, too, use caterpillars as food for
their young. These insects paralyze their prey
by stinging it, lay their eggs on the helpless
body, and seal it up in a hollow reed, or in
a nest of mud. When the wasp larva hatches
it finds plenty of living food at hand.</p>

<p>Chrysalids also are eaten by birds and by
various carnivorous insects, and are frequently
killed by parasitic wasps and flies. Many an
amateur butterfly-hunter has been puzzled to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
see that some of his chrysalids produce, not
beautiful butterflies, but a lot of insignificant
little wasps.</p>

<p>Adult butterflies are not much troubled by
parasitic insects, but they are eaten by many
birds, particularly those of the fly-catcher type,
by lizards, and by the larger dragonflies.
Spiders kill a few, the great gray robber-flies
carry off a butterfly now and then, and frogs
and toads take them whenever possible. They
are not much attacked by the mammals, but
I have seen a chipmunk devour a large <i>Papilio
turnus</i> with every symptom of satisfaction.</p>

<p>Long ages of struggle with these enemies
have developed certain protective devices&mdash;not
through any supernatural intervention or any
conscious activity on the part of the butterflies,
but simply by the mechanical process
called natural selection. There is a certain degree
of variation among all animals, and some
of these variations are transmitted to succeeding
generations. Now, if certain butterflies
happen to vary in such a way that they are
protected against their enemies, they survive
at the expense of their less fortunate fellows,
and such of their offspring as inherit the protective
variation also survive, until at last, by
a gradual process of elimination, the entire
species is protected.</p>


<h3 class="center">PROTECTIVE COLORATION</h3>

<p>One of the commonest of the protective devices
is called <i>protective coloration</i>. It may be
noted that many caterpillars are green, a color<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
which blends well with that of the leaves upon
which they feed, and so protects them in a
measure from the prying eyes of their enemies.
Such chrysalids as are attached to green leaves
or twigs are often green also, but most caterpillars
leave the foliage to pupate, and the
chrysalids are neutral gray or brown so as to
be inconspicuous against a background of bark
or dead wood. Many butterflies pass the winter
in the chrysalis state, and these cold
weather chrysalids are never green, but usually
some dull color which harmonizes with the
winter landscape.</p>

<p>Another thing to be noted, particularly in
caterpillars, is the operation of the so-called
<i>law of counter-shading</i>, which means simply
that the part of the body which gets the most
light is usually darkest in color. Some caterpillars
habitually feed with their feet downward,
and their backs are darker than their
bellies; others are accustomed to feed in the
opposite position, and the shading tones are reversed.
One has only to look at a few living
specimens in their native haunts to see the
value of this arrangement.</p>

<p>In adult butterflies it may be observed that
it is the upper side of the wings which shows
the bright colors, while the lower side is much
less conspicuous. The flying butterfly is not
in much danger anyway, and a display of color
can do no great damage, but it might be fatal
to the same insect at rest. At rest, however,
the wings are usually brought together vertically,
so that the highly colored upper side
is quite concealed, and only the dull under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
surface exposed to view. In some butterflies&mdash;<i>Vanessa
antiopa</i>, for example&mdash;the lower surface
so nearly resembles the bark upon which
the insect is accustomed to rest that it can
hardly be distinguished, even when one knows
exactly where to look for it.</p>

<p>Some of these protected butterflies illustrate
a minor protective phenomenon known as
<i>dazzling</i> or <i>eclipsing coloration</i>. Many observers
believe that the sudden change from
the bright colors of the flying butterfly to the
neutral tints of the same specimen at rest is
more confusing to a pursuer than the total absence
of brilliant colors. This dazzling and
eclipsing effect is particularly noticeable in
various species of <i>Grapta</i> and <i>Vanessa</i>.</p>

<p>Another thing to be remarked is the fact
that many butterflies protectively colored, such
as those mentioned above, usually alight on
some object similar in color to the lower side
of their own wings. These butterflies are accustomed
to rest upon the trunks of trees, and
almost invariably select one with dark-colored
bark, avoiding green or light-colored trees such
as birches and sycamores. It is not claimed the
individual butterfly, after examining the colors
of its wings, casts about for a perch to match,
but it is quite conceivable that those which
were attracted to light-colored bark have been
gradually weeded out of the species.</p>


<h3 class="center">OFFENSIVE ODORS AND TASTES</h3>

<p>Besides the method of protective coloration,
some caterpillars are protected against birds
by sharp spines or hairs; others by peculiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
markings and attitudes said to approximate the
appearance of serpents or other dangerous objects.
Many butterflies, it has been observed,
are protected by still other methods. The common
Monarch (<i>Anosia plexippus</i>), the Zebra
butterfly (<i>Heliconius charitonius</i>), and the Red
Silverwing (<i>Dione vanillae</i>) are very conspicuous
butterflies, yet they flutter leisurely about
unmolested by birds and other enemies. This
protection is due to what Alfred Russell Wallace
called “a strong, pungent, semi-aromatic
odor, which seems to pervade all the juices of
their system.”</p>

<p>It has long been known that certain butterflies
produced disagreeable odors, but Fritz
Müller, working in Brazil as early as 1876, was
the first to give the matter any very serious attention.
Since Müller’s time extensive studies
have been made by Colonel Longstaff and Dr.
Dixey, two English entomologists, but very little
has been done in North America. It is
certainly true, however, that the three butterflies
mentioned above (and doubtless many
others) are possessed of some taste or odor
offensive to their enemies.</p>

<p><i>Dione vanillae</i> is more abundant in South
America than in the United States, and was
one of the species investigated by Müller, who
writes: “The males ... when seized, open
wide the anal valvulae, from the inner side
of which there appear two glands yielding a
strong and nauseous smell. The females, on
the contrary, emit a similar smell from a yellow
gland extruded on the dorsum between the
last and penultimate segments.” Longstaff,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
who studied this butterfly in Jamaica, describes
it as “a beautiful but ill-smelling Fritillary”
and says it smells like cow-dung.</p>


<h3 class="center">WARNING COLORATION</h3>

<p>It has been noticed that many dangerous and
distasteful insects are rendered conspicuous by
their brilliant colors, and examples of this so-called
<i>warning coloration</i> are not lacking
among the butterflies. The Swallowtail caterpillars,
which produce a very disagreeable odor,
are usually marked by two great staring eye-spots
on the back of the thorax. Some of the
protected butterflies, such as the ill-smelling
Zebra and Red Silverwing, are extraordinarily
conspicuous by reason of striking color-combinations.
Many entomologists believe that
these peculiar color-schemes have been developed
by protected butterflies as an advertisement
of their inedible character. This view
is not as popular as it used to be, but there
may be something in it; it certainly seems to
explain the structure and habits of some of
the higher animals&mdash;the rattlesnake for example&mdash;better
than any other hypothesis yet
advanced.</p>


<h3 class="center">PROTECTIVE MIMICRY</h3>

<p>There seems to be a tendency among certain
insects which are edible and unprotected, to
bear a superficial resemblance to inedible or
distasteful species. Thus certain harmless flies
have developed a remarkable likeness to wasps
and bumblebees, although in structure and
habits they are really very different. Several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
diurnal moths, too, have transparent wings, and
yellow bands about the body which give them
the appearance of gigantic and singularly
ferocious hornets. It is certainly a great advantage
for a harmless insect to resemble some
dangerous and inedible species, and the whole
phenomenon of resemblance has been called
<i>protective mimicry</i>.</p>

<p>The best example of mimicry in American
butterflies is the case of the Monarch (<i>Anosia
plexippus</i>) and the Viceroy (<i>Basilarchia disippus</i>).
The Monarch belongs to the subfamily
<i>Euploeinae</i>, all the members of which are provided
with secretions which render them distasteful
to birds and predaceous insects. The
Monarch advertises its inedibility by its bright
brown and black wings, and its leisurely manner
of flight. The Viceroy belongs to an altogether
different group, the members of which
are readily eaten by birds, and which do not
resemble the Monarch either in form, coloration,
or manner of flight. The Viceroy, however,
has gradually developed so remarkable
a resemblance to the Monarch that it is difficult
to distinguish them at a little distance,
although the Viceroy is much the smaller of
the two, and has a traverse black band on the
hind wing that is lacking in the Monarch.
There is no doubt that the Viceroy benefits by
this resemblance, as birds (doubtless mistaking
it for the inedible Monarch) appear to
give it a wide berth.</p>

<p>This novel situation is supposed to have
come about as follows: In the remote past the
Viceroy was a blue-and-black butterfly like its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
relatives, but because of the abiding principle
of variation the individuals of the species were
not exactly alike&mdash;some specimens were lighter
than others. For some reason or other these
lighter-colored butterflies had a slight advantage
in the struggle for existence, and so in
time the entire species was of this type, the
darker specimens having been exterminated.
Finally, some individuals chanced to bear a
slight resemblance to distasteful butterflies
of the Monarch type, so that birds avoided
them, but continued to feed upon their less
fortunate relatives. Thus, through a long process
of natural selection, the Viceroy has come
to resemble the Monarch.</p>


<h3 class="center">HELIOTROPISM AND LIST</h3>

<p>It was long ago observed that plants respond
definitely and mechanically to the direction
of rays of light; the leaves and flowers
of many plants always turn toward the sun
and even follow its daily course, so that the
flower which turned to the East in the morning
faces due West at sunset. Similar phenomena
are now known to occur in animals.
Among butterflies a good example is that of
the Mourning Cloak (<i>Vanessa antiopa</i>). This
butterfly, when it alights in the sunlight, almost
invariably turns about until its body lies
parallel with the rays of light and its head
points directly away from the sun. This phenomenon
is known as <i>negative heliotropism</i>,
and a number of plausible explanations of it
have been advanced. Probably it is merely
another method of blending with the background,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
akin to protective coloration. When
the Mourning Cloak alights upon the ground,
or upon a log, it closes its wings and becomes
well-nigh indistinguishable from its surroundings,
because the under side of the wings is
protectively colored. Now, if the body lies at
right angles to the sun’s rays, the wings cast
a large shadow, much more conspicuous than
the butterfly itself, and hence attracting unfriendly
eyes to the butterfly. If however the
body is in line with the rays of light, and the
wings brought together vertically, the shadow
is insignificant. One has only to pin a few
dead butterflies on a smooth neutral background
in full sunlight to see the force of this
theory. It is very probable, then, that <i>negative
heliotropism</i> is simply a method of reducing
the too-conspicuous shadow to its lowest terms.</p>

<p>Other butterflies reduce the shadow by what
is known as <i>list</i>, leaning far over to one side
like a sail-boat in a storm&mdash;hence the name.
The best American example of <i>list</i> is found
in the behavior of the Wood-nymph butterfly
(<i>Satyrus alope</i>), which is often seen to topple
over to one side, presenting the entire wing
surface to the source of light, lowering the
top-line and thus reducing the shadow.</p>


<h3 class="center">FEIGNING DEATH</h3>

<p>Many insects, particularly beetles, frequently
escape their enemies by feigning death.
Whether this behavior is an instinctive ruse
or a genuine paralysis induced by something
akin to fright we do not know, but it is doubtless
of considerable value to the insect. Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
butterflies have been known to play possum
when in a tight place. <i>Vanessa cardui</i>, known
as the Painted Lady, sometimes closes its
wings, folds its legs close to the body, and
falls motionless to the ground. Usually it is
lost in the weeds or grasses, but even if found
and picked up it often allows itself to be handled
without any sign of life. Similar behavior
has been reported in <i>Satyrus alope</i>,
the Wood-nymph butterfly.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
